Data Archive

- Store immutable weekly snapshots here: `data-archive/YYYY/WW/`
- Each folder should contain the raw CSVs used for that week (e.g., `cad.csv`, `phone.csv`) and optional derived summaries.
- When scaffolding a post, copy from the archive into `posts/YYYY-MM-DD/data/` so past posts render identically.
